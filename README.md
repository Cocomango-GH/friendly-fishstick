####code that chanllenge me
```js
// this line removes flipped from the second element in the array the second line subtracts two from the score and the three line turns the flipped array back to empty so we can pick of the cards for  matches.
//this was my biggest challenge and getting the matching to work. 
 flipped[0].classList.remove('flipped');
        flipped[1].classList.remove('flipped');
        score -= 2;
        flipped = [];
```
